### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on creating an interactive map of the places (historical and still around) found in Edward P Jones's collection "Lost in the City"
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python (for data analysis), and anything else that can help me make little applications
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate + help with writing web crawling and how the heck to use mapbox
- 😄 Pronouns: He, Him, His
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have no idea what I am doing
