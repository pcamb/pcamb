### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**pcamb/pcamb** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating an interactive map of the places (historical and still around) found in Edward P Jones's collection "Lost in the City"
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python (for data analysis), and anything else that can help me make little applications
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate + help with writing web crawling and how the heck to use mapbox
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: He, Him, His
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have no idea what I am doing
